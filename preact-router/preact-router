# Preact Router

Connect your Preact components up  to that address bar.

preact-router provides a <Router /> component that conditionally renders its children
when the URL matches their path.
It also automatically wires up <a /> elements to the router.


## Usage Example

import Router from 'preact-router'
import { h, render } from 'preact'

const Main = () => (
  <Router>
    <Home path="/" />
    <About path="/about" />
    <Search path="/search/:query/:advanced?" />
  </Router>
);

render(<Main />, document.body)

If there is an error rendering the destination route, a 404 will be displayed.


## Handling URLS

Page are just regular components that get mountedd when you navigate to a certain URL.
Any URL parameters get passed to the component as props.

Defining what componnent(s) to load for a given URL is easy and declarative.
You can even mix-and-match URL parameters and normal props.
You can also make params optional by ading a ? to it.

<Router>
  <A path="/" />
  <B path="/b" id="42" />
  <C path="/c/:id" />
  <C path="/d/:optional?/:params?" />
  <D default>
</Router>
