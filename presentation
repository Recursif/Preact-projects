# Preact

Fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API.

## A different kind of library.

### Clocer to the metal

Preact provides the thinnest possible Virtual DOM abstraction on top
of the DOM.

The web is a stable platform, it"s time we stopped reimplementing
it in the name of safety.

Preact is also a first-class citizen of the web platform.

I diffs VIrtual DOM against the DOM itself, registers reals event handlers,
and plays nicely with other libraries.

### Small Size

Most UI frameworks are large enough to be the majority of an app's Javascript size.

Preact is different: it's small enough that your code is the largest part of your application.

That means less Javascript to download, parse and execute - leaving more time for your code,
so you can build an experience you define without fighting to keep a framework under control.

### Big performance

Preact is fast, and not just because of its size.

it's one of the fastest Virtual DOM libraries out there, thanks
to a simple and predictable diff implementation.

It even includes extra performance features like customizable update batching,
optional async rendering, DOM recycling, and optimized event handling via Linked State.

### Portable and embeddable

Preact's tiny footprint means you can  take the powerful
Virtual DOM Component paradigm to new places it couldn't otherwise go.

Use Preact to build parts of an app without complex integration.
Embeb Preact into a widget and  apply the same tools and techniques that you would to build a full app.


### Instantly Productive

Lightweight is a lot more fun when you don't have to sacrifice
productivity to get there, Preact gets you productive right away.

It even has a few bonus features :

- props, state and context are passed to render()

- Use standard HTML attributes like class and for

- Works with React DevTools right out of the box


### Ecosystem Compatible

Virtual DOM Components make it easy to shrare reusable things -
everything from buttons to data providers.

Preact's design means you can seamlessly use thousand of Components
available in the React ecosystem.

Adding a simple preact-compat alias to your bundler provides a compatibility layer that
enables even the most complex React components to be used in your application.
